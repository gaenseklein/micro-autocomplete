# autocomplete plugin for micro text editor

a small plugin for the micro texteditor to replace the inbuild autocomplete with a plugin.
as its a plugin its easier to alter its way and experiment with different ways to do this task.

differences to the build-in autocomplete:
- bash-shell-like going forward autocomplete
- includes points and slashes into word-building
- includes all open buffers in open micro instance for word-building instead only actual focused one
